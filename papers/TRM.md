## High-Level Summary

-   Introduces *Tiny Recursive Model* (TRM), a new small model, with hierarchy:
    -   high-level is current best guess to answer
    -   low-level does latent reasoning
-   Builds on, refines and improves ideas from [HRM](HRM.html), without focusing on biological analogies
-   Gets 45% accuracy on ARC-AGI-1 with only 7M parameters
